# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```bash
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
import { kittn } from 'kittn';

const api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

```csharp
public enum FileMode
{
    CreateNew = 1,
    Create = 2,
    Open = 3,
    OpenOrCreate = 4,
    Truncate = 5,
    Append = 6,
}
```
> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](https://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class=notice>
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```bash
curl "https://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
import { kittn } from 'kittn';

const api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
const kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

```csharp
public string GetName(int ID)
{
    if (ID < names.Length)
        return names[ID];
    else
        return String.Empty;
}
private string[] names = ["Spencer", "Sally", "Doug"];
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
   {
      "id":         1,
      "name":       "Fluffums",
      "breed":      "calico",
      "fluffiness": 6,
      "cuteness":   7
   },
   {
      "id":         2,
      "name":       "Max",
      "breed":      "unknown",
      "fluffiness": 5,
      "cuteness":   10
   }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves all kittens.
